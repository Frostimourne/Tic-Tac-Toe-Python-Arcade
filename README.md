# Overview

Having grown up around video games my whole life, I've always been interested in making one myself some day.  Since we've all got to start somewhere, I decided that for my first foray into a game with an actual GUI, I should keep it simple to not become ovewhelmed.

Tic Tac Toe is a wonderful game to learn a new module with.  The concept is simple, but comes with layered logic that needs to be tweaked and debugged.  Tracking players' turns, checking for game over conditions, handling valid and invalid moves, now with the added challenge of dealing with more complex postioning instead of simple arrays and text outputs brought a very satisfying challenge.

# Development Environment

Sticking with VSCode for now, since each of my projects so far have been in different languages.

While I have coded in Python before for small scripts, this is the first time I've used Python Arcade.  Learning the order of operations for Arcade interactibles, sprites, collisions, etc. has certainly been a treat.
